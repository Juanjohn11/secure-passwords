# Challanging 

it took me forever to finish but I managed to make it kinda easier on me by separating the work into different functions. The easy part of the the whole challange was the prompts as its self explantory somewhat.

## Description

once you click the generate button it will prompt to ask you about the length, lowercase, uppercase and symbols that can be added within your password. however you must choose at least once lowercase, uppercase or symbol in order to generate a passsword. as well you must choose a length between 8-128, if not it will put the user in a loop til either the length or the lowercase, uppercase and/or symbols meet the critera in order to generate a proper password.
